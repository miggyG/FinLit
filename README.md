# FinLit
This goes through a list of stocks for the next 7 days goes to marketwatch.com for each stock and gets last 100 headlines and uses Vader Sentiment Analysis to see if it is positive or negative then returns a compound score of the headlines to see wether the news of the company is positive or negative. It returns a list of tickers then a library of each ticker with the compound score. 0.0 is neutrual and closer to 1 the more positive closer to -1 is more negative

this is for The Stock Market Game in my Financial Literacy Class any stock with the last closing price below $3 and a market cap below 25 mil is tossed out.

To do:
use historical data 
look into using news bodies rather than just headlines
make faster??
